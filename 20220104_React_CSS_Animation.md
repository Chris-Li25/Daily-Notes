# React CSS动画

### React Transition Group

The [`TransitionGroup`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/tree/v1-stable#low-level-api-transitiongroup) add-on component is a low-level API for animation, and [`CSSTransitionGroup`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/tree/v1-stable#high-level-api-csstransitiongroup) is an add-on component for easily implementing basic CSS animations and transitions.



### High-level API: CSSTransitionGroup

`CSSTransitionGroup` is a high-level API based on [`TransitionGroup`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/tree/v1-stable#low-level-api-transitiongroup) and is an easy way to perform CSS transitions and animations when a React component enters or leaves the DOM. It's inspired by the excellent [ng-animate](http://www.nganimate.org/) library.
